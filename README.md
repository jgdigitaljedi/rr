Week 5 Hack day

This was a 2 day hackathon project at MakerSquare during week 5 of our class. My team consited of Daniel Cox and Austin Sprawls. We had almost zero AngularJS experience prior to this but decided to force ourselves to do a single page application using Angular.

The inspiration came from the day before when a large group of us had a difficult time deciding where to eat. Inspired by life, we wrote this app. Location is based off of IP address so may not work 100% of the time. It depends on your ISP or whether or not you are using VPN. We've voiced the desire to continue with the project, but are currently very busy. Changes may come at a later date.
